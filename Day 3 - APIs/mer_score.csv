Then villages, which is a small collection of dwellings with services, such as a pub, church, shop etc.

A town is a larger settlement, that either historically was given market town status (the right to have a market on set days of the week) nowadays, have an economic centre. 

A city is a large settlement, that historically had to have a cathedral, however the only thing that is needed is for it to be officially made a city b the Monarch (really the government, as they choose and she signs when told to) 

Now our smallest city is called St Davids, which has around 2000 people, but this is a bit of a quirk as it has a cathedral and therefore was always known as a city, and was again given city status to commemorate an event, in contrast Reading has a population of 250 000 but is a town not a City","Dixville Notch: Joe Biden wins unanimously in the first town to announce 2020 presidential election results","","https://www.9news.com.au/world/dixville-notch-first-town-in-america-to-vote-new-hampshire-ballot-cast-results/c3e78d61-5b79-4f0d-9360-b88af9118678","9news.com.au","https://www.reddit.com/comments/jn4qbv/?ref=search_posts","No Error",0.0879817,0.03572502,0.094266236

Which, to be clear, is what any place with a population of only five should be. Dixville Notch is likely only an incorporated municipality because its population *used* to be high enough to justify it, and the state can't be bothered to disincorporate it.

Edit: according to [another comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jn4qbv/dixville_notch_joe_biden_wins_unanimously_in_the/gazx3yg/), Dixville Notch is, in fact, unincorporated.
